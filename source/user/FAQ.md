Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

This document aims to cover the most frequently asked questions concerning the GhostBSD operating system. Although originally intended to reduce bandwidth and avoid the same old questions being asked over and over again, FAQs have become recognized as valuable information resources.

Every effort has been made to make this FAQ as informative as possible; if you have any suggestions as to how it may be improved, please feel free to contact us.

## Introduction

### What is GhostBSD?

Briefly, GhostBSD is a UNIX®-like operating system. It works on AMD64 and Intel® platforms. GhostBSD is based on FreeBSD, which is based on U.C. Berkeley’s “4.4BSD-Lite” release, with some “4.4BSD-Lite2” enhancements. It is also based indirectly on William Jolitz’s port of U.C. Berkeley’s “Net/2” to the i386, known as “386BSD”, though very little of the 386BSD code remains. At this time, GhostBSD provides MATE desktop as default version, and a community release with XFCE desktop.

### On which FreeBSD branch is GhostBSD based on?

GhostBSD is based on the FreeBSD 13.0-STABLE branch.

.. The differences between GhostBSD and FreeBSD you will find here.

### Who can use GhostBSD?

GhostBSD can be used by companies, researchers, data scientists, computer professionals, students, and home users all over the world in their work, education, and recreation.

### What is the goal of the GhostBSD Project?

The goal of the GhostBSD Project is to combine the ease of use of a set of GTK desktops with security and flexibility of the underlying FreeBSD mechanisms. GhostBSD is a great tool to learn FreeBSD and start one’s adventure in the BSD world. GhostBSD may be used for any purpose and without strings attached.

### Does the GhostBSD license have any restrictions?

Yes. Those restrictions do not control how you use the code, merely how you treat the GhostBSD Project itself. If you have serious license concerns, read the actual license. For the simply curious, the license can be summarized like this:

* Do not claim that you wrote this.
* Do not sue us if it breaks.

### Can GhostBSD replace my current operating system?

For most users, yes.

Most people do not actually use an operating system. They use applications, as these are what really makes a computer useful. GhostBSD is designed to provide a desktop and full-featured environment for applications. It supports a wide variety of web browsers, office suites, email readers, graphics programs, programming environments, network servers, and just about everything else you might want. Most of these applications can be built using the FreeBSD Ports Collection.

If you need to use an application that is only available on one operating system, you cannot easily replace that operating system (this situation is referred to as vendor lock-in). However chances are that there is a very similar application on GhostBSD, however. If you want a solid office or internet server, a reliable workstation, or just the ability to do your job without interruptions, GhostBSD will almost certainly do everything you need.

If you are migrating to GhostBSD from some other UNIX®-like environment, you already know most of what you need to know. If your background is in graphic-driven operating systems such as Microsoft Windows® and older versions of MacOS®, expect to invest additional time learning the UNIX way of doing things.

### Why is it called GhostBSD?

GhostBSD was developed as an operating system to hack on Gnome using BSD technology. After a while it became what was referred to as “Gnome hosted by BSD”, which means that Gnome is hosted on the FreeBSD system. Now that we support multiple GTK desktops it is more accurate to call it "GTK hosted by BSD".

### What is the latest version of GhostBSD?

At this point in time, we are at version with Mate Desktop or XFCE Desktop.

Releases are usually made every few months.

GhostBSD users can keep their system up-to-date by using Software Station.

### When are GhostBSD releases made?


The development team releases a new version more or less every couple of months. A testing period precedes each release in order to ensure that the addition of new features does not compromise the stability of the release.

### How can I contribute?

There is a number of ways to contribute to the GhostBSD project:

* If you possess abilities in programming and knowledge of the FreeBSD operating system, or you simply want to learn these things, you might want to consider joining the team by becoming an active developer. If you are feeling adventurous, you might want to try building GhostBSD, but you might as well join us on Telegram to get in touch with the team and see what work currently has to be done.
* If you are interested in helping form the artistic perspective, you could contribute fan art, logos, wallpapers, or help design/maintain the website layout. In this case, join us on Telegram.
* If you have decent writing skills and know English quite well, you might want to help by writing documents and producing website and wiki content. Get in touch with us on Telegram.
* If none of the above apply to you, you might just want to use GhostBSD and tell us about bugs you've discovered and the ideas you have about how to improve the system You can report them via forums. You might also consider simply spreading the word about GhostBSD!
* On the Contribution page you will get more information.

If you feel like you might be able to help us grow and improve GhostBSD in any of the above ways (or any other way you can come up with), please contact us using the forums, or join us on Telegram.
