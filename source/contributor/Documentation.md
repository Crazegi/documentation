<h1>Documentation</h1>

Writing documentation is a great way to start improving GhostBSD user experience and you will be helping a lot of GhostBSD users to better understand their desktop and applications. Anyone with reasonable English skills and good knowledge of FreeBSD, GhostBSD or MATE can help.

## Communicating with the team

There are many ways to get in touch with the team:
* [GhostBSD Dev](https://t.me/ghostbsd_dev) Group on Telegram
* [#ghostbsd-dev:libera.chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ghostbsd-dev:libera.chat) channel on Matrix
* #ghostbsd-dev on the Libera Chat IRC.

Those 3 ways of communicating are connected together.

## Getting the resources

In order to document GhostBSD projects, you will want to run a [recent GhostBSD build](https://www.ghostbsd.org/download#latest_builds), and to document third-party projects, you will also need a recent version of that program. We are use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) with [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) to makes it easy to create our Documentation Hub. Any one that wants to help should start to be familiar with [Git](Getting_Started.md#knowing-how-to-use-git), [GitHub](Getting_Started.md#knowing-how-to-use-github) and [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

The instruction to install and setup found at on [GhostBSD Documentation GitHub](https://github.com/ghostbsd/documentation#local-development-server) repository.
