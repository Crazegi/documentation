## Overview

GhostBSD is a simple, elegant, and friendly BSD operating system for desktops and laptops based on FreeBSD. GhostBSD is a slow-rolling release while some GNU/Linux distros are on the bleeding edge side; we tried to offer a stable update and release cycle. The official desktop environment is MATE. The system comes with a graphical application to install software and update your system. Most codecs to play multimedia files are pre-installed. The installer leverages OpenZFS makes it easy to install and is suitable for newcomers to BSD. With modest hardware requirements, GhostBSD is ideal for modern workstations and 64-bit single-board computer hardware.

## Our Goal

In general, BSD is also considered beyond the average computer user's knowledge. We try to simplify FreeBSD to lower the entry-level of using FreeBSD on a desktop or laptop. We provide all the benefits of the FreeBSD operating system benefits combined with our in-house GUI tool.
